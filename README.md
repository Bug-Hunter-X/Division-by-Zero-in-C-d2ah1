This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero.  The `bug.c` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, leading to undefined behavior (often a program crash). The `bugSolution.c` file shows how to prevent this error by adding a check to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing the division. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in C applications.
